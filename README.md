# bluehose

Bluehose is my attempt at making something like Firehose, but for UMich.

The code is probably terrible - its my first Vue.js project, and basically my first javascript project too!
If you have any suggestions, features or bugs, _please_ let me know by raising an issue in the Github project, or by contacting me!
